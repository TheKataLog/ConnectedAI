This diagram illustrates the overall system context of the ShopWise AI Assistant. It shows how:

1. A **Customer** interacts with the **Web-Based AI Support Assistant** via the e-commerce platform to query product or order details.
2. The assistant sends all requests to the **Responsible AI and Machine Learning Ops Platform** for monitoring and compliance.
3. In future, fine-tuned LLM models will be deployed for the assistant's agents to utilize, ensuring accurate and responsible behavior.
