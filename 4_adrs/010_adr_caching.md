# ADR010 - Implement Caching Mechanisms

## Status  
Proposed  

## Context and Problem Statement  
Caching can significantly improve system performance by reducing load on services and speeding up responses. The challenge is to determine appropriate caching layers, strategies, and data to cache for maximizing efficiency while ensuring data consistency.

### Requirements  
- Reduce service load and response times for frequently accessed or computationally expensive data.  
- Implement robust cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency.  
- Ensure scalability to handle increased traffic and data volume.

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- Frequently accessed data can be cached without significantly impacting accuracy.  
- Server-side caching with tools like Redis or Memcached can integrate easily into the existing architecture.  
- A combination of client-side and server-side caching may be required for optimal performance.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Performance: Improve response times and reduce service load.  
- Scalability: Support growing user traffic and data volumes.  
- Consistency: Maintain data integrity with appropriate cache invalidation policies.  
- Simplicity: Minimize complexity in implementation and maintenance.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. Client-Side Caching  
- **Advantages:** Reduces server load by caching responses on the client side.  
- **Disadvantages:** Limited control over cache invalidation and prone to stale data.

### 2. Server-Side Caching with Redis or Memcached (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Centralized caching, fast access to frequently used data, supports scalability.  
- **Disadvantages:** Requires additional infrastructure and careful configuration to avoid stale data.

### 3. No Caching  
- **Advantages:** Simplifies implementation, ensures data is always fresh.  
- **Disadvantages:** Increased service load and slower response times, especially for expensive computations.

## Decision  
Server-side caching using Redis or Memcached will be implemented to optimize performance and scalability.  

### Reasons  
- Centralized caching is easier to manage and scale.  
- Redis and Memcached provide robust support for caching frequently accessed and computationally expensive data.  
- Cache invalidation strategies and TTL settings ensure data consistency while improving performance.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Faster response times for end-users.  
- Reduced load on backend services, improving overall system performance.  
- Scalable solution that can grow with user demand.

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Additional infrastructure required for caching servers.  
- Complexity in managing cache invalidation policies to ensure data consistency.  
- Requires monitoring to prevent memory exhaustion in caching layers.
