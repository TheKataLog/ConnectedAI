# ADR003 - Implement a Custom API Gateway

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
The AI assistant requires secure and efficient communication with multiple microservices. The challenge is to choose an approach that balances flexibility, security, performance, and cost while supporting the specific needs of the system.  

### Requirements  
- Robust security for inter-service communication.  
- Customizable routing and load balancing tailored to system architecture.  
- High performance with minimal latency.  
- Ability to integrate seamlessly with existing and future microservices.  

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- Off-the-shelf solutions may include features that are unnecessary for the project, leading to increased costs and overhead.  
- A custom gateway can be tailored to address specific security and routing needs but will require additional development effort.  
- The system architecture will evolve, necessitating a flexible and scalable API gateway solution.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Security: The gateway must enforce strict security measures for inter-service communication.  
- Performance: Minimize latency and optimize throughput for high-frequency service calls.  
- Flexibility: Support custom routing, monitoring, and integration needs.  
- Cost-efficiency: Avoid additional costs associated with unused features in pre-built solutions.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. Off-the-Shelf API Gateways (e.g., Apigee, Kong)  
- **Advantages:** Pre-built, feature-rich, easy integration, and well-documented.  
- **Disadvantages:** May include unnecessary features, additional licensing costs, and limited flexibility for customization.

### 2. No API Gateway  
- **Advantages:** Simplifies architecture, reduces initial setup effort.  
- **Disadvantages:** Complicates microservice communication, lacks centralized security and routing controls, increases redundancy in service handling.

### 3. Custom API Gateway (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Tailored to specific security, routing, and performance needs. Fully customizable and integrates seamlessly with existing architecture.  
- **Disadvantages:** Increased development and maintenance complexity, requiring dedicated resources.

## Decision  
A custom API gateway will be developed to meet the specific integration, security, and performance needs of the AI assistant’s microservices.  

### Reasons  
- Provides complete control over routing, security, and monitoring tailored to ShopWise’s unique requirements.  
- Avoids unnecessary costs and overhead associated with off-the-shelf solutions.  
- Supports future architectural changes and scaling without dependence on third-party providers.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Optimized for performance and security based on specific business requirements.  
- Greater flexibility for customizations, such as tailored routing and monitoring.  
- Ensures seamless integration with the existing and evolving microservice architecture.  

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Higher development and maintenance costs compared to off-the-shelf solutions.  
- Requires dedicated resources for implementation and ongoing updates.  
- Longer initial development timeline compared to pre-built solutions.
