# ADR004 - Use In-Memory State for Session Management

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
Session management is critical for enabling multi-turn dialogues in the AI assistant. The challenge is to select a session management approach that provides fast access to state information while balancing complexity, scalability, and reliability.  

### Requirements  
- Low-latency access to session state for real-time interactions.  
- Simplicity in implementation and maintenance.  
- Scalability to handle increasing numbers of concurrent sessions.  
- Minimal impact on system performance during peak loads.  

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- Session state is primarily short-lived and only required for the duration of the interaction.  
- Data persistence for session state during outages is not a strict requirement.  
- The system will rely on other mechanisms (e.g., user history) for reconstructing state if needed after interruptions.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Speed: Sessions must be retrieved and updated with minimal latency.  
- Simplicity: Implementation should avoid unnecessary complexity.  
- Scalability: The approach must support high concurrency.  
- Trade-offs between reliability and performance must favor real-time responsiveness.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. Persist State in a Database  
- **Advantages:** Provides durability, ensuring session state is retained during outages or restarts.  
- **Disadvantages:** Adds latency to every state access, increases implementation complexity, and may introduce bottlenecks under high load.

### 2. Hybrid State Management (In-Memory + Persistent Storage)  
- **Advantages:** Balances durability and speed by persisting critical session data while keeping frequently accessed data in memory.  
- **Disadvantages:** Adds significant implementation complexity and scalability challenges.

### 3. In-Memory State Management (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Provides the fastest access to session state, simple to implement, and scales well with system resources.  
- **Disadvantages:** Session state is lost if the system restarts or scales down unexpectedly.

## Decision  
The AI assistant will manage session state in memory, prioritizing quick access and efficient performance during interactions. Future work will explore hybrid state management to provide durability and persistence for session data.

### Reasons  
- In-memory state management ensures low-latency access, critical for real-time dialogue systems.  
- Simplifies implementation and reduces overhead compared to database or hybrid approaches.  
- Aligns with the short-lived nature of session data, making persistence less critical.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Faster responses during interactions due to low-latency state retrieval.  
- Simpler implementation and reduced system complexity.  
- Scales effectively with system resources, supporting high concurrency.  

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Sessions are lost if the system restarts or scales down unexpectedly.  
- Does not provide durability for long-lived or critical session data.  
- Requires careful resource management to prevent memory exhaustion under heavy load.
