# ADR009 - Define Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

## Status  
Proposed  

## Context and Problem Statement  
A robust CI/CD pipeline is crucial for rapid development, consistent testing, and reliable deployment of services. Decisions need to be made on the tools and practices for automating these processes.

### Requirements  
- Automate testing to ensure code quality and reliability.  
- Enable continuous delivery for fast, reliable deployments.  
- Support scalable integration with development workflows.  

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- Development is primarily hosted on Git-based platforms.  
- The team has experience with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Automate repetitive processes to improve efficiency.  
- Maintain consistent quality through automated testing.  
- Support rapid iteration and deployment.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. GitHub Actions  
- **Advantages:** Integrated with GitHub repositories, easy to configure.  
- **Disadvantages:** Limited to GitHub-hosted projects.

### 2. Jenkins  
- **Advantages:** Flexible, widely used, and open-source.  
- **Disadvantages:** Requires more setup and maintenance effort.

### 3. GitLab CI/CD  
- **Advantages:** Fully integrated into GitLab, robust pipeline management.  
- **Disadvantages:** Less flexible if using non-GitLab repositories.

## Decision  
GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD pipelines, leveraging its tight integration with GitHub repositories. Offline evaluation of the AI assistant against a ground truth testset will be a key component of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Streamlined development and deployment process.  
- Improved code quality through automated testing and linting.  

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Limited flexibility if the team moves to non-GitHub repositories.
