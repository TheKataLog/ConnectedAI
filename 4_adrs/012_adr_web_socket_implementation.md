# ADR012 - Use WebSocket Implementation in the Frontend to Support Streaming Responses

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
The AI assistant requires real-time, streaming responses to provide a more interactive and responsive user experience. Traditional HTTP-based communication (e.g., REST) does not efficiently support streaming responses due to its request-response model. A decision is needed to enable efficient real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

### Requirements  
- Support real-time, low-latency communication for streaming responses.  
- Maintain a persistent connection between the frontend and backend during a session.  
- Ensure compatibility with the existing infrastructure and frontend frameworks.  

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- Streaming responses will improve user experience by delivering partial results as they become available.  
- WebSocket technology is supported by both the frontend and backend frameworks.  
- The infrastructure can handle persistent connections without significant overhead.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Real-time responsiveness to improve user interaction.  
- Scalability to handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections.  
- Simplicity of implementation and integration with the current stack.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. WebSockets (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Supports full-duplex communication, low latency, and real-time streaming.  
- **Disadvantages:** Requires persistent connections, which may increase server load.

### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)  
- **Advantages:** Simpler than WebSockets for one-way streaming from server to client.  
- **Disadvantages:** Does not support full-duplex communication (e.g., client-to-server interactions).

### 3. Long Polling  
- **Advantages:** Works with traditional HTTP infrastructure.  
- **Disadvantages:** Inefficient for real-time updates, introduces higher latency, and increases server load.

### 4. REST with Periodic Polling  
- **Advantages:** Simple to implement in traditional architectures.  
- **Disadvantages:** High latency, inefficient for frequent updates, and not suitable for streaming.

## Decision  
WebSockets will be implemented in the frontend to enable real-time, full-duplex communication for streaming responses.  

### Reasons  
- WebSockets provide a persistent connection that supports real-time, bi-directional communication.  
- Low latency ensures a better user experience during streaming interactions.  
- Scalable WebSocket implementations are supported by modern frontend and backend frameworks.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Improved user experience with real-time, streaming responses.  
- Efficient communication model for interactive features like chat interfaces or progressive data loading.  
- Better alignment with real-time application needs.  

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Increased server resource usage due to maintaining persistent connections.  
- Requires additional implementation and testing effort to handle WebSocket connections reliably.  
- Backend and infrastructure must support scaling for high concurrency.  

## Implementation Notes  
- Use WebSocket libraries or frameworks compatible with the frontend (e.g., `socket.io`, native WebSocket API).  
- Ensure proper error handling and reconnection strategies in case of connection failures.  
- Monitor WebSocket connections to prevent resource exhaustion on the server.
