# ADR011 - Use Containerization with Docker for Cloud Run Deployment

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
Containerizing applications using Docker ensures consistent deployments by encapsulating application dependencies and environments. Google Cloud Run, a fully managed serverless platform, simplifies the orchestration and deployment of containerized applications, removing the need for managing Kubernetes clusters.

### Requirements  
- Consistent application deployment across development, staging, and production environments.  
- Scalable and serverless orchestration for containerized services.  
- Minimize operational overhead for managing infrastructure.  
- Ensure compatibility with existing development workflows.  

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- Docker will be used to containerize applications, packaging all dependencies into a single artifact.  
- Cloud Run will handle the orchestration, scaling, and deployment of containerized services.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Deployment consistency and reliability.  
- Scalability and automatic handling of traffic spikes.  
- Reduced operational complexity with managed orchestration.  
- Cost efficiency, with pay-per-use pricing.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. Docker with Cloud Run (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Simplifies deployment with a serverless model, ensuring scalability and reliability without managing clusters.  
- **Disadvantages:** Limited control over infrastructure configuration compared to self-managed solutions like Kubernetes.

### 2. Docker with Kubernetes (GKE)  
- **Advantages:** Provides full control over orchestration, supports more complex workloads.  
- **Disadvantages:** Overkill for the project's needs, increases operational complexity.

### 3. Traditional Deployment Without Containers  
- **Advantages:** Simpler for small-scale applications without dynamic scaling needs.  
- **Disadvantages:** Lacks consistency, scalability, and flexibility provided by containerization.

## Decision  
Docker will be used for containerizing applications, creating artifacts for deployment on Google Cloud Run. This approach ensures consistency in deployments while leveraging the scalability and simplicity of a serverless orchestration platform.

### Reasons  
- Docker encapsulates dependencies, ensuring consistent application behavior across environments.  
- Cloud Run eliminates the need to manage servers or orchestration infrastructure, reducing operational burden.  
- Automatic scaling supports traffic spikes without manual intervention, aligning with project scalability needs.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Simplified deployment process with minimal operational overhead.  
- Scalable architecture that automatically adjusts to demand.  
- Consistent application behavior across development, staging, and production environments.  
- Improved developer productivity by focusing on application logic rather than infrastructure management.  

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Limited control over infrastructure and orchestration compared to Kubernetes.  
- Cloud Run's serverless nature may impose restrictions on non-HTTP workloads or applications requiring long-running processes.  
- Potential vendor lock-in with reliance on Google Cloud's managed services.  

## Implementation Notes  
- Build Docker images for each service, including all dependencies.  
- Deploy Docker containers to Google Cloud Run, configuring necessary environment variables and runtime settings.  
- Monitor resource usage and scaling behavior using Cloud Run's built-in monitoring tools.  
- Regularly update Docker images to ensure security patches and application updates are deployed efficiently.
