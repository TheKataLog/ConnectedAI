# ADR008 - Implement Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
Security is paramount for protecting user data and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific features and information within the AI assistant. The implemented solution must support both authenticated user login and guest access while maintaining security, simplicity, and scalability.

### Requirements  
- Secure authentication for user identity verification.  
- Support for guest access for unauthenticated users.  
- Compatibility with distributed systems and frontend frameworks.  
- Easy integration with future authentication enhancements (e.g., OAuth2, SSO).  

### Business or Technical Assumptions  
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used to manage authentication tokens.  
- Guest access should be secure and prevent unauthorized escalation of privileges.  
- The frontend will handle login and guest access workflows while integrating seamlessly with backend APIs.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Secure and flexible user authentication and access control.  
- Simple and user-friendly login experience, including guest access.  
- Scalability to support a growing user base.  
- Future-proofing to allow for integration with external identity providers if needed.  

## Considered Options  

### 1. Username/Password Authentication with JWT (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Lightweight, stateless authentication; easily scalable for distributed systems; supports frontend/backend separation.  
- **Disadvantages:** Relies on secure implementation and key management.

### 2. OAuth 2.0  
- **Advantages:** Industry-standard, widely supported, suitable for integrating with third-party identity providers.  
- **Disadvantages:** More complex implementation than JWT for initial deployment.

### 3. Third-Party Identity Providers (e.g., Google, Facebook)  
- **Advantages:** Simplifies authentication and reduces development effort.  
- **Disadvantages:** Adds dependency on external providers and limits control over the process.

### 4. Guest Access Implementation  
- **Advantages:** Allows quick access for unauthenticated users, enhancing user experience.  
- **Disadvantages:** Must be carefully managed to avoid privilege escalation or abuse.

## Decision  
Username/password authentication with JWT is implemented for user authentication, along with secure guest access to allow unauthenticated users to interact with the system with limited functionality.

### Reasons  
- JWT provides lightweight, stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems.  
- Username/password login aligns with current requirements while allowing for future enhancements.  
- Guest access implementation enhances user experience by allowing unauthenticated interactions without compromising security.  

## Consequences  

### Positive Impacts  
- Simple and secure authentication for users and guests.  
- Stateless JWT implementation ensures scalability and ease of integration.  
- Flexible design supports future enhancements like OAuth2 or third-party identity providers.  

### Trade-offs and Limitations  
- Requires secure key management to prevent JWT token misuse.  
- Guest access introduces additional responsibility for monitoring and limiting access rights.  

## Implementation Notes  
- The frontend uses React to manage login workflows, including a username/password form and a guest access option.  
- JWT tokens are issued upon successful login or guest access and are used for authenticating API requests.  
- Secure error handling is implemented to notify users of authentication failures without exposing sensitive information.  
- Guest access is limited to specific API endpoints to prevent privilege escalation.
